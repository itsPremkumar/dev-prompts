# dev-prompts — 150 developer productivity prompts

A categorized prompt pack for AI coding agents: planning, debugging, code review,
refactoring, docs, testing, architecture. Paste into OpenClaw/Hermes or your editor.

## Install
No code to run. The prompts live in `PROMPTS.md` (150 entries, grouped by category).
Copy any block into your agent chat.

## Categories (sample)
- Planning & scoping
- Debugging & root-cause
- Code review checklists
- Refactoring & DRY
- Docs & READMEs
- Tests & edge cases

## Why
Prompts are the cheapest lever for agent quality. This pack is the free, MIT-licensed
core; an expanded bundle (500+ prompts + a prompt-linter) is on Gumroad.
